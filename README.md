# Mini extension coding interview
Mini extension coding challenge is a react project that seeks to test your knowledge in the use of airtable database and airtable API. This project uses redux to deploy the entire state of the app which is fetched from the [airtable database](https://airtable.com/app8ZbcPx7dkpOnP0)

[Read the requirement here](https://app.miniextensions.com/form/VZeThdPvzkFvgBx9j7tb) 

## Built With
- React (A free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on UI components)
- Redux
- Typescript.
- CSS module
- Airtable and Airtable API

### Prerequisites
The basic requirements for building the executable are:

- A working browser application (Google chrome, Mozilla Fire fox, Microsoft edge ...)
- VSCode or any other equivalent code editor
- Node Package Manager (For installing packages like Lighthous, webhint & stylelint used for checking for debugging bad codes before deployment)
## Getting packages and dependencies
To get all package modules required to build the project run:
```
npm install
```
every package module required to build the project is listed in the package.json file. this is used as a reference to get all dependencies.

## Building 

To build the project run:
```
npm run build
```
after you run this sucessfully you'd locate the build from in the ```build``` folder located from the parent directory of the project.

## Running

To run the program on a browser through a server run this command in your cli
```
npm start
```
This should open the page in your localhost on port 3000. then you'd be able to view the built page generated using webpack.
